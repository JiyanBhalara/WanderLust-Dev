## Efficiency Methods üöÄ

1. **Server-Side Rendering (EJS):** Improves performance by generating pages on the server, reducing client-side processing.
2. **Database Indexing (MongoDB):** Common queries are optimized with indexes to speed up data retrieval.
3. **Efficient Routing (Express):** Utilizes modular routes for better organization and quicker responses.
4. **Caching Strategies:** Uses HTTP headers and/or in-memory caching (if configured) to reduce load times.
5. **Minification & Compression:** Serving compressed responses (using Express middleware) for faster data transfer.
6. **Optimized Images (Cloud Hosting):** Hosting images on a CDN or optimized server for improved load times and bandwidth usage (if you use Cloudinary or similar).

## Packages Used üì¶

Below is a brief description of key packages and dependencies used in **WanderLust**:

1. **[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)**  
   - A minimal and flexible Node.js web framework used to build our server and handle routes.

2. **[Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)**  
   - An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It helps in managing data schemas and relationships.

3. **[EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)**  
   - Templating engine that allows embedding JavaScript into HTML. Used for server-side rendering of pages.

4. **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**  
   - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive data like API keys and passwords secure.

5. **[body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)**  
   - Middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, making form and JSON data easier to handle.

6. **[method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override)**  
   - Allows you to use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn‚Äôt support it natively (e.g., HTML forms).

7. **[bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)**  
   - A library for hashing passwords to enhance security.

8. **[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)**  
   - Provides session management for Express, storing user data between HTTP requests.

9. **[passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)** (If used)  
   - Authentication middleware for Node.js. Easily integrates with various strategies for secure login.

10. **[multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)** (If used)  
    - A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for image or file uploads.

11. **[cloudinary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary)** (If used)  
    - A cloud-based image and video management service for easier uploads, transformations, and optimizations.
